**Project Context:**

The project involves controlling a simulated MyCobot 280 robotic arm for a cube stacking task.
* **ROS Distro:** ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco
* **Simulation:** Gazebo (Ignition Gazebo)
* **Motion Planning:** MoveIt 2
* **Robot:** MyCobot 280 (simulated)
* **Core Task:** Launching a stacking task via `mycobot_stacking_project/launch/start_stacking_task.launch.py`.
* **Log Analysis Reference:** (You can point to the previous detailed analysis you received for further context if needed).
* **Codebase:** The primary package to focus on is `mycobot_stacking_project`, along with its interactions with `mycobot_gazebo` and `mycobot_moveit_config`. The relevant files are within the uploaded `FedVLA_sim-manual_cube_addition` directory.

**Objective:**

Fix two critical issues preventing the successful execution of the robot's motion plan. The robot plans successfully but fails during execution.

**Essential Issues to Address:**

**Issue 1: Redundant and Failing Controller Loading in Launch File**

* **Problematic File:** `mycobot_stacking_project/launch/start_stacking_task.launch.py`
* **Current Behavior:**
    * The launch file includes `mycobot_gazebo/launch/mycobot.gazebo.launch.py`, which correctly loads and activates the ROS 2 controllers (`joint_state_broadcaster`, `arm_controller`, `gripper_action_controller`) via the `gz_ros2_control` plugin within Gazebo. This is successful according to the logs (e.g., `[gazebo-2] [INFO] ... [controller_manager]: Activating controllers: [ joint_state_broadcaster ]`).
    * Subsequently, `start_stacking_task.launch.py` uses `ExecuteProcess` with a `TimerAction` to explicitly run `ros2 control load_controller --set-state active ...` for each of these controllers *again*.
* **Errors Observed in Logs:**
    * `[ros2-13] Controller : joint_state_broadcaster already loaded, skipping load_controller!`
    * `[gazebo-2] [ERROR] ... [controller_manager]: Controller 'joint_state_broadcaster' can not be configured from 'active' state.`
    * `[ERROR] [ros2-13]: process has died [pid ..., exit code 1, cmd 'ros2 control load_controller --set-state active joint_state_broadcaster']`
    * Similar errors occur for `arm_controller` (process `ros2-14`) and `gripper_action_controller` (process `ros2-15`).
* **Required Fix in `mycobot_stacking_project/launch/start_stacking_task.launch.py`:**
    1.  **Remove Redundant `ExecuteProcess` Calls:** Delete the `ExecuteProcess` nodes responsible for loading and activating `joint_state_broadcaster`, `arm_controller`, and `gripper_action_controller`. These are likely named `load_joint_state_broadcaster_cmd`, `load_arm_controller_cmd`, and `load_gripper_controller_cmd` in the launch file, or similar.
    2.  **Remove Associated Event Handlers and Timers:** Delete any `RegisterEventHandler` or `TimerAction` that are specifically tied to these removed `ExecuteProcess` calls. The current 15-second `TimerAction` is used to delay these redundant commands; this specific timer and its purpose should be removed.
    3.  **Rely on `gz_ros2_control`:** Ensure the system relies solely on the `gz_ros2_control` plugin (launched via the included `mycobot.gazebo.launch.py`) for loading and activating these controllers. The logs confirm this part is already working successfully *before* the redundant calls.
    4.  **Adjust Node Startup Delays (If Necessary):** If other nodes (like `stacking_manager_node`) require a delay to ensure Gazebo and MoveIt are fully initialized, a *single* `TimerAction` before launching such application nodes might be appropriate, but it should not be for reloading controllers.

**Issue 2: MoveIt Execution Failure due to Action Communication Breakdown**

* **Problematic Behavior:** The `stacking_manager_node` successfully plans a motion (e.g., to the "home" state), but when `move_group` attempts to execute this plan, it reports an `UNKNOWN` status, causing the `stacking_manager_node` to abort.
* **Log Evidence:**
    * The `arm_controller` (running in Gazebo) reports success: `[gazebo-2] [INFO] ... [arm_controller]: Goal reached, success!`
    * However, `move_group` (specifically `moveit_simple_controller_manager`) logs errors:
        * `[move_group-6] [ERROR] ... [moveit_simple_controller_manager.rclcpp_action]: unknown goal response, ignoring...`
        * `[move_group-6] [ERROR] ... [moveit_simple_controller_manager.rclcpp_action]: unknown result response, ignoring...`
    * This leads to:
        * `[move_group-6] [WARN] ... Controller handle arm_controller reports status UNKNOWN`
        * `[move_group-6] [INFO] ... Completed trajectory execution with status UNKNOWN ...`
    * And finally, the application node fails:
        * `[stacking_manager_node-16] [ERROR] ... MoveGroupInterface::execute() failed or timeout reached`
* **Required Investigation and Potential Fixes:**
    1.  **Review Action Client/Server Interaction:** The issue lies in the communication between the `FollowJointTrajectory` action client in `moveit_simple_controller_manager` (part of `move_group`) and the action server provided by the `arm_controller` (via `ros2_control` in Gazebo).
    2.  **Check Quality of Service (QoS) Settings:**
        * Investigate the default QoS settings used by `moveit_simple_controller_manager` for its action clients.
        * Investigate the default QoS settings used by `ros2_control` (specifically for the `joint_trajectory_controller/JointTrajectoryController`) for its action servers.
        * Mismatched or incompatible QoS profiles (especially regarding reliability or history depth for action feedback/status/result topics) can cause messages to be dropped or ignored.
        * Consider explicitly setting compatible QoS profiles if a mismatch is suspected. Refer to ROS 2 documentation on QoS profiles for actions.
    3.  **Inspect Controller Configuration:**
        * Verify `mycobot_moveit_config/config/mycobot_280/moveit_controllers.yaml` (used by MoveIt) and `mycobot_moveit_config/config/mycobot_280/ros2_controllers.yaml` (used by `ros2_control`). Ensure the controller names, types, and action namespaces (`follow_joint_trajectory`) are consistent and correctly configured. The logs suggest basic controller loading is fine, but subtle misconfigurations affecting action communication might exist.
    4.  **Timing and Synchronization:** While less likely to be the sole cause given the controller *does* execute, ensure there are no extreme timing discrepancies. The previous fix for Issue 1 should simplify the launch timing.
    5.  **Debugging `moveit_simple_controller_manager`:**
        * If possible, increase the logging verbosity for `move_group` and specifically for `moveit_simple_controller_manager` to get more insight into how it's handling action client states and responses.
        * Use ROS 2 CLI tools to inspect the action topics during execution:
            * `ros2 action info /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory`
            * `ros2 topic echo /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/_action/feedback`
            * `ros2 topic echo /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/_action/status`
            * `ros2 topic echo /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/_action/goal` (if you can capture it)
            * `ros2 topic echo /arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory/_action/result`
            This can help verify if the controller is publishing all necessary action lifecycle messages correctly and if `move_group` should be seeing them.
    6.  **Alternative Solutions (If direct fix is elusive):**
        * As a last resort, if `moveit_simple_controller_manager` proves problematic, investigate if `moveit_ros_control_interface` (if compatible and available for this setup) offers a more robust alternative controller manager for MoveIt. This would be a more significant change.

**Priority:**

Please prioritize fixing **Issue 1** first, as it will simplify the launch process and remove misleading errors. Then, focus on **Issue 2**, which is the direct cause of the task failure.

Provide the modified `mycobot_stacking_project/launch/start_stacking_task.launch.py` file and any other configuration files that need changes. If code changes are needed in C++ files (e.g., to adjust QoS settings programmatically, though configuration is preferred), please provide those as well, clearly commenting on the changes.
